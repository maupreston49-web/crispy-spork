<h2>Calm Surrender</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our first priority is achieving a state of calm surrender in your dog: a regulated nervous system, loose body, and soft jaw. Only then will commands take hold.</li>
<li>We start with decompression walks and engagement games to reduce over‑arousal and build trust.</li>
<li>Your dog learns to accept guidance calmly, making future commands more effective.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nose → Eyes → Ears</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dogs learn through their senses in a specific order. We begin with the nose (scent exploration), then progress to eyes (visual focus), and finally ears (verbal cues).</li>
<li>This sequence ensures your dog fully processes new environments and tasks, building confidence and trust.</li>
<li>By respecting this natural order, training becomes more intuitive and effective.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trust → Respect → Love</h2>
<ul>
<li>We build relationships with dogs in the order of trust, respect, and love.</li>
<li>Trust is developed through calm leadership and consistent guidance.</li>
<li>Respect grows as your dog understands boundaries and expectations.</li>
<li>Love flourishes once trust and respect are established, leading to deep and lasting bonds.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see these principles in action, choose a mission type that suits your dog’s drive and temperament.</p>
